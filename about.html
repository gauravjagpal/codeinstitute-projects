                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Hello! My name is John Smith and I am a Nutritional Advisor. Since my diagnosis, I have
                        developed a huge passion for all things health and wellness.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Since my Crohn's disease diagnosis in 2018, I have spent most of my free time researching into
                        ways I can heal naturally.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I came across some revolutionary science that is completely different to all of the noise we
                        currently have in the health & wellness space, and I am extremely excited to show you what
                        worked for me. I want everyone with auto-immune disease to know that there are ways to heal
                        without having to adhere to strict dietary & lifestyle protocols.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I hope it can change your life, because you deserve nothing but happiness and vibrant health.

                        <strong>MY STRUGGLES</strong>
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        I felt like I was held hostage by these strict FAD diets. I jumped from diet to diet and whilst
                        I acknowledge that a healthy diet is crucial for a healthy mind and body, it isn't going to save
                        everyone from severe inflammatory diseases.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I was determined to find a way to heal without having to be held hostage by a diet.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        As well as a healthy fibre rich diet, I also wanted to enjoy sugar, fried food, pizza, burgers,
                        and fries (in moderation of course) without the feeling of guilt or pain. And I knew this is
                        only possible if I think outside the box.
